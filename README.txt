Explanation: This program displays the result of greatest common divisor between 2 numbers. The 2 numbers are the sum of
numbers in each array, where both arrays are consists of 10 random numbers each. The 2 sums will be displayed. 
There are 2 methods options to run the program, which are recursive and iterative. The end of program shows another way to
implement the GCD method, this time calculating the GCD of many numbers instead of just 2. The program also calculates the average
of all the different numbers(integer) in file. The results of all these explanations will be displayed in the screen. 


How to run the program : After the file FinalProject.java has been compiled, decide which method to use 
and enter between recursive and iterative(lower or upper case). If the user enters between those 2 words, display the results and the program ends there. 
Otherwise, it will ask the user whether he/she wants to continue or not. If continue, type yes. If not, type no. If the user input is yes,
ask again if the user wants to use recursive or iterative. If the user input is no, quit the program but it will still
prints the results that are related to file integers.txt(average and GCD of numbers in file).


Known bugs: There are no bugs in the program.
